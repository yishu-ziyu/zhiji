You must use Skill('yishuship:e2e'). Skip preamble and auth gate.

Codify the change's acceptance criteria as persistent end-to-end tests
committed to the repo. You are the first automated verification gate —
running before review, so a green suite means reviewers see working code.

IMPORTANT:
- Detect the existing E2E framework first (references/frameworks.md). If
  nothing exists, scaffold the default for this stack (references/scaffolding.md).
  Scaffolding is allowed — we want durable tests, not ephemeral proofs.
- Write tests under the framework's idiomatic test directory and commit them.
- Run the new tests AND the existing E2E suite. Both must pass before you
  mark this phase DONE. A test that only passes on retry is NOT passing —
  fix the root cause.
- If a test fails because the implementation is wrong (not a test issue),
  report FAIL with the failing test name and evidence. Do NOT weaken the
  assertion to make it green — the downstream e2e_fix loop will route
  back to dev to fix the code.
- Base your tests on the SPEC's acceptance criteria and the git diff —
  these are the inputs of record. A QA report does NOT exist yet at this
  point in the pipeline (QA runs after review, not before you).
- Skip the phase (SKIP verdict) only if the diff is docs-only or has no
  user-observable effect. Write a short justification to report.md.
- Cleanup is mandatory — follow .shared/cleanup.md with your EVIDENCE_DIR.
