You must use Skill('yishuship:handoff'). Skip preamble and auth gate.

Ship the implementation: commit, push, create/update PR, work CI loop until green.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT finish until the PR is merge-ready. Relevant checks must be
green with no relevant pending checks, actionable review feedback must be
addressed or escalated, and mergeStateStatus must be merge-ready (CLEAN,
HAS_HOOKS, or UNSTABLE only when all failing checks are explicitly
irrelevant/non-blocking). There must be no merge conflicts, no unresolved local
conflict state, and no required update-from-base left undone. If CI fails,
comments require mechanical fixes, or mergeStateStatus is
BEHIND/DIRTY/BLOCKED/UNKNOWN, fix inside the handoff loop, verify locally,
push, and wait again. Sync with base only when drift, conflicts, or repo
policy require it; do not sync preemptively. Prefer rebase
when it preserves clean history safely. For an already-pushed PR branch, rebase
only if the branch is agent-owned, there are no human approvals or unresolved
human review threads, no other author has pushed commits, and the repo appears
to expect linear history. Push rebases with `--force-with-lease`, never plain
`--force`. If those safety gates fail, use merge/update-branch or escalate.
