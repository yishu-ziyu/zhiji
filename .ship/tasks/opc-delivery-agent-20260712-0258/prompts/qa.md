You must use Skill('yishuship:qa'). Skip preamble and auth gate.

Exploratory verification of the running application. E2E tests have
already run and passed — your job is to find what those tests did NOT
cover: UX problems, edge cases, visual regressions, perf issues, or
anything the codified suite couldn't see.

IMPORTANT: You MUST start the application and test it interactively.
- If the diff touches frontend/UI → use browser testing (references/browser.md)
- If the project is an Electron app → use Electron automation (references/electron.md)
  Use agent-browser via CDP — do NOT use computer-use/request_access (Electron apps
  register as "Electron Helper (Renderer)", not as a named macOS app).
  Read the reference BEFORE attempting anything to avoid wasted retries.
- If the diff touches API endpoints → use API testing (references/api.md)
- If the diff touches CLI → use CLI testing (references/cli.md)
Do NOT skip interactive testing. "E2E tests passed" is the baseline you're
building on, not a substitute — you're exploring beyond the codified cases.
Every acceptance criterion still needs direct evidence (screenshot, curl
output, command output) from your own interactive session.

Context:
- E2E suite just passed — green regression tests already exist in the repo.
  Focus your energy on exploration beyond those codified flows.
- Review is also clean — correctness concerns already addressed statically.
